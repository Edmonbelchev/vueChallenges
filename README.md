# vueChallenges

Here you can see different challenges I've tried from this website: https://tutorialzine.com/2016/03/5-practical-examples-for-learning-vue-js
I've also used <b>Vue Routes</b> to navigate thru different pages.

ðŸŒŠ 1. <b>Inline Editor</b> > Click on the text and when the input pops up try to type something in it. <br>
ðŸŒŠ 2. <b>Order Form</b> > Click on some of the items in order to purchase it. <br>
ðŸŒŠ 3. <b>Search Bar</b> > I'm a big <b>Marvel</b> fan so I've decided on this challenge to put some of their movies. Type something on the search field to filter thru their movies.
